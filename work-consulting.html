      <p>Sarting from the Home page, the dashboard was deisgned to provide immediate visibility into workflow and key metrics, while highlighting any critical information or action items. ForMoving into the next step of the user journey, the dashboard provided quick access to click through to those details and common searches.

              <p>While constraints did not allow for a live code style guide, it was my recommendation for next steps. Not only will it be easier to maintain over time, they make it possible to see how styles and interactions will actually be rendered - EG. a button hover state that looked good on paper (in Sketch with side by side), but when coded revealed that the shade difference was too subtle to detect. In subsequent projects I also discovered opportunities to leverage coded style guides for multi-lingual design, VQA, and accessibility.</p>
